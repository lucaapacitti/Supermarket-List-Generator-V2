**SUPERMARKET LIST GENERATOR (REVISITED)**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**DESCRIPTION**
Going to the supermarket is a very common aspect of most people's everyday lives. However, the cost of the average food shop has gone through the roof in recent years, with no sign of that coming down. This has left many working class people anxious about the amount of money they are spending - just on the basics to feed themselves and their families.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to predict how much a weekly food shop will cost, and the common shopping list containing just the names of categories of products (for example: bread, eggs, mince), as a pose to the name of a specific product, does not help this matter. The program that I am designing here takes two key parameters from the user: a common shopping list as described above, and a budget. It then compares the list to a supermarket's database of products, and generates a product-specific list of all items at their highest possible quality, whilst remaining within the budget set by the user.

I originally built this program in 2024 using the procedural programming paradigm in C#. However, I have decided to revisit this using an object-oriented approach to apply what I have learned at university so far. Upon reflection, I also concluded that my original program had a poor and untidy code structure, so I am improving upon that by modularising my code, and designing the backend and frontend independently. I will be improving upon the way the backend of my code deals with the underlying database - rather than reading and writing to the database every time any action is carried out, I will make use of object serialisation so that any necessary access or modification is done via data structures local to my code.
